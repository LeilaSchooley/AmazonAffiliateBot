1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
“Grandpa, if it doesn’t

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,800
work this time, I

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,200
don't know what I’ll

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
do without you” The

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,000
granddaughter said through heavy

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,350
tears.

7
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,400
“It will work.

8
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
Me and him have

9
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,500
a deal.

10
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,900
He never breaks a

11
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,300
deal” The grandfather tried

12
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,700
to say this soothingly

13
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,100
to his granddaughter but

14
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,500
lapses of shaky fear

15
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,900
made its way through

16
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,300
with each pause of

17
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,000
the sentence.

18
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
She broke down sobbing

19
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,800
and laid her head

20
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,200
against the scratchy, dark

21
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
brown, wool blanket her

22
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,000
grandfather had draped over

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
his body while he

24
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,800
lay back against a

25
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,850
mountain of pillows.

26
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,250
There was an in-home

27
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,650
heart monitor that sat

28
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,050
next to the small

29
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,450
twin sized mattress her

30
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,850
grandfather had against the

31
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,250
far wall of his

32
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,650
small room, the room

33
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,050
being just long enough

34
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,450
to accommodate the length

35
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,500
of his bed.

36
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,900
The grandfather's hands had

37
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
become so frail, a

38
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,700
once powerful chin and

39
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,100
strong cheekbones sat wrinkled

40
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,500
and withered with age

41
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,200
and sickness.

42
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
His hair at a

43
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
time had such length

44
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,400
to it, hanging at

45
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,800
least a foot past

46
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
his shoulders, silky jet

47
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
black with almost streaks

48
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
of brown that ran

49
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,050
through thick curls.

50
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,450
There was almost nothing

51
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,850
left of his hair.

52
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,250
The granddaughter almost couldn’t

53
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,650
recognize those deep and

54
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,350
sunken eyes.

55
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,750
“Bring it here” The

56
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,800
grandfather said shakily.

57
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Without question the granddaughter

58
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,600
left the room hurriedly.

59
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
Five minutes later she

60
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
returned with a basket

61
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,800
that had a cloth

62
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,200
over the top of

63
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,550
it.

64
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,950
She set it down

65
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,350
on her grandfather's lap

66
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,750
and then sat down

67
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,150
herself with her face

68
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,200
in her hands.

69
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
The grandfather grabbed a

70
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
large knife from the

71
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
small bedside table, raising

72
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
it above the basket

73
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
with both hands with

74
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
the point facing straight

75
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:36,950
down.

76
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,350
The sound of a

77
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,750
child crying sounded from

78
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,150
the basket and the

79
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,550
granddaughter walked over to

80
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,950
the wall, facing it

81
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,350
with her face still

82
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,750
in her hands sobbing

83
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,100
hysterically.

84
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
“It’ll be okay dear.

85
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
Your mother had to

86
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,300
do this once too,

87
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,700
I only ever ask

88
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,050
once.

89
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,450
Thank you for your

90
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,850
sacrifice.” With those words

91
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,250
the grandfather plunged the

92
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,650
knife into the basket.

93
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,050
The child's crying stopped.

94
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,450
A soft whisper sounded

95
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,500
through the room.

96
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,900
"Another measly 40 years

97
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,950
old man… "
